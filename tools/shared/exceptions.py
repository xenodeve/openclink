"""
Custom exceptions for OpenClink tools.

These exceptions allow tools to signal protocol-level errors that should be surfaced
to MCP clients using the `isError` flag on `CallToolResult`. Raising one of these
exceptions ensures the low-level server adapter marks the result as an error while
preserving the structured payload we pass through the exception message.
